# Week Planner (Svelte version)

I have written the same app in Svelte and React. This is the Svelte version. They will be presented on my channel to compare the concepts and developer experience of both frameworks.

It is a basic week planner in which plans for every week can be managed. Plans are saved in local storage of the browser.

## Comparison of bundle sizes

This is the size of the bundled, built assets (CSS + JS). Both versions use Vite.

-   [React version](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/week-planning-react): **231.4 KB** (gzip: **71.93 KB**)
-   [Svelte version](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/week-planning-svelte): **33.27 KB** (gzip: **12.74 KB**)

These results are quite shocking and are similar to the findings of my earlier [framework comparison project](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/shopping-list-frameworks).
